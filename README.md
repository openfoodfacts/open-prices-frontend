### Looking for the Open Prices API?

- Open Prices API Documentation: https://prices.openfoodfacts.org/api/docs
- Make sure you comply with the OdBL licence, mentioning the source of your data, and ensuring to avoid combining non free data you can't release legally as open data. Another requirement is contributing back any product you add using this SDK.
- Please get in touch at reuse@openfoodfacts.org
- We are very interested in learning what the Open Prices data is used for. It is not mandatory, but we would very much appreciate it if you tell us about your re-uses (https://forms.gle/hwaeqBfs8ywwhbTg8) so that we can share them with the Open Food Facts community. And we would be happy to feature it here: https://prices.openfoodfacts.org/community

### UXR (User Experience Research)

- [![Figma](https://img.shields.io/badge/figma-%23F24E1E.svg?logo=figma&logoColor=white) Open Prices UX audit](https://www.figma.com/board/gPtsX2q0ZF6WElF7YSAYjz/Open-Prices---UX-Audit?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=wzAYUqVEBRQWoOmM-0)

### 🎨 Design & User interface

- The Open Prices server is exposed through the Mobile App and the Open Prices frontend (and probably elsewhere in the future, thanks to web components)
- We strive to thoughtfully design every feature before we move on to implementation, so that we respect Open Food Facts' graphic charter and nascent design system, while having efficient user flows.
